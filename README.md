## AutoPot: LLM-Driven Honeypots on Remote Access Protocols

AutoPot is an experimental Telnet honeypot that replaces scripted replies with responses generated by a large language model. The goal is to demonstrate how dynamic deception can harden remote access protocols (Telnet, SSH, etc.) against adaptive, LLM-powered attackers by simulating a stateful, human-like operator.

### arXiv Link:
- Coming soon.

### Core goals
1. Prototype a GenAI-powered Telnet listener that proxies attacker inputs through our model to craft realistic shell-style replies.
2. Validate feasibility with both passive capture of real botnet traffic and purpose-built scripted sessions, so we can observe adaptive behavior under different context lengths.
3. Catalogue findings in a paper for arXiv.

### Architecture
- **Telnet listener and session manager** that mediates every incoming connection.
- **GenAI engine** interacting with a Qwen2.5-coder1.5b fine-tuned (LoRA) on the following datasets:
    - [https://huggingface.co/datasets/hotal/honeypot_logs](https://huggingface.co/datasets/hotal/honeypot_logs)
    - [https://huggingface.co/datasets/palisaderesearch/LLM-Honeypot-Logs ](https://huggingface.co/datasets/palisaderesearch/LLM-Honeypot-Logs)
- **Logging and evaluation suite** to capture session activity, response metrics, and provide inputs for comparison with baseline honeypots such as Cowrie.
- **Data sources** consisting of passive logs from exposed endpoints and synthetic scripted attacker sessions to measure adaptive behavior.
